# Salesforce Api
A simple demonstration about how to query on Salesforce.
In this case, we are doing a query on Lead object.

**IMPORTANT:**
- If you can't find your client_id and client_secret: In your Salesforce account settings, create your app user by going into menu "Create" > "Apps" > "Connected Apps" > "Create". After that, Salesforce will give your client_id and client_secret
- If you can't find your security token, reset by going on "My Settings" > "Personal" > "Reset my security key". The key will be sent by email
- The password and the security token must be passed together when you fetch for access token
